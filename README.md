# Netflix by Genre

This simple script provides a pre-formatted url for a specific genre of Netflix programming.
I created this script to 'practice' my understanding of python and to put my newly-found knowledge to work!


### HowTo

**To use, simply start the script and follow the commands!**

the script has a dictionary of genres by name and their associated genre 'id'. You can go from *I want to watch a {genre} movie/tv show* to /*watching/* it in a few simple steps!

#### 1. start the script
#### 2. enter the genre you want to watch (or type 'help' for full list of genres)
#### 3. copy the url and past it into your favorite web browser!
